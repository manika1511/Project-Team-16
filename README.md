# EMERGENCY 911 ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

![Alt text](download.jpg?raw=true)
 
This project aims at giving a snapshot of the emergencies occurring in an area over the period which can help the Emergency Services to make available more resources in the emergency prone area. We will plot the emergency occurrences for the location using Google Maps API. Additionally, the location can be zoomed to provide the weekly statistics in a graphical form for data visualization.

Also, we will analyze the data of a week on an hourly basis to predict the timespan at which there is a high probability of an emergency occurrence and then present the data graphically. By looking at the graph, we will predict the trend of emergencies. For instance, in case of vehicle accidents, analyzing the data to find the hour of the day when the number of vehicle accidents were maximum. This would help the emergency services to make sure that they can deploy more resources at that time of the day.

We will also compare the occurrences of different emergency types like Assault, Accidents, Fire, Medical Emergencies etc. For instance, when there are emergencies of one type occurring more frequently than others, the graph can help the emergency services to allocate the resources accordingly.

## ok.. I like it. However 911 analysis itself does not provide enough value. Add the following:
<li> how many are fake 911 calls made? and how much they cost to the police dept?
<li> bring the small business data and find correlation between number of small business in the area and number of 911 calls made in that cluster
<li> bring the home value data into picture and find correlation
If all 3 implemented , APPROVED
